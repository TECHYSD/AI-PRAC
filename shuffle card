#now, let's start using loops to add our content:
for i in range(2,11):
cardfaces.append(str(i)) #this adds numbers 2-10 and converts them to stringdata
for j in range(4):
cardfaces.append(royals[j]) #this will add the royal faces to the cardbase
for k in range(4): for l in
range(13):
card = (cardfaces[l] + " of " + suits[k])
#this makes each card, cycling through suits, but first through faces
deck.append(card)
#this adds the information to the "full deck" we want to make#now let's shuffle our
deck!
random.shuffle(deck)
#now let'ssee the cards!
for m in range(52):
